**Build Small, Grow On Demand**

*We write code the same way we eat an apple — one bite at a time.*

* **Start with the thinnest slice that works.**
  Create the minimal file/function to satisfy the current task; no extra layers, no “just-in-case” helpers.

* **Add structure only when duplication hurts.**
  Feel the pain twice before introducing a new abstraction.

* **Every PR should be runnable end-to-end.**
  Even early scaffolding must compile, lint, and pass tests.

* **Delete as eagerly as you add.**
  Dead code is worse than no code.
