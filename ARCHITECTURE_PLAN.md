# Personal AI Assistant - Multi-Agent Architecture Plan

## 🎯 Vision
Transform from single-agent complexity to specialized multi-agent collaboration with reasoning chains and contextual validation.

## 🔍 Current System Problems

### ❌ Issues Identified:
1. **Cognitive Overload**: Single agent handling 5+ different responsibilities
2. **No Reasoning Chain**: Direct tool calls without analysis
3. **Context Blindness**: "Mehmet Emin" → "Mehmet Tamer" without validation
4. **No Clarification**: Accepts ambiguous inputs without questions

## 🏗️ Proposed Architecture

### Multi-Agent Handoff Network:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Reasoning Agent │ ← Main coordinator & synthesizer
│   (Orchestrator)│
└─────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ handoff │
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────┐
    │ Memory  │   ← Specialized memory operations
    │ Agent   │
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────┐
    │Validation│   ← Context & consistency checking
    │ Agent   │
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────┐
    │  File   │   ← Document & media handling
    │ Agent   │
    └─────────┘
```

### 🧠 Agent Responsibilities:

#### 1. Reasoning Agent (Main Coordinator)
- **Purpose**: Strategic thinking and decision making
- **Tools**: None (pure reasoning)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Analyze user requests
  - Decide which specialist agent to engage
  - Ask clarifying questions
  - Synthesize final responses
  - Handle uncertainty and ambiguity

#### 2. Memory Agent (Information Specialist)
- **Purpose**: All memory operations
- **Tools**: `store_memory`, `search_memory`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Store new information
  - Retrieve relevant memories
  - Detect potential duplicates
  - Maintain memory consistency

#### 3. Validation Agent (Consistency Guardian)
- **Purpose**: Context validation and conflict resolution
- **Tools**: `search_memory`, `compare_entities`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Compare new info with existing data
  - Detect contradictions
  - Request clarification when needed
  - Maintain entity consistency

#### 4. File Agent (Document Specialist)
- **Purpose**: File and media operations
- **Tools**: `file_retriever`, `analyze_media`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Retrieve and send files
  - Analyze images/audio
  - Manage file metadata

#### 5. Preference Agent (Settings Specialist)
- **Purpose**: User preference management
- **Tools**: `set_user_preference`, `get_preferences`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Update user settings
  - Maintain preference consistency
  - Handle preference conflicts

#### 6. Web Agent (Research Specialist)
- **Purpose**: External information gathering
- **Tools**: `web_search`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Real-time web searches
  - Fact verification
  - Current event updates

## 🔄 Handoff Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Ambiguous Person Reference
```
User: "Mehmet Tamer'in doğum günü 8 Temmuz 1999"

1. Reasoning Agent: 
   - Analyzes: "Person info update needed"
   - Handoff → Memory Agent

2. Memory Agent:
   - Searches for "Mehmet" entries
   - Finds "Mehmet Emin" record
   - Handoff → Validation Agent

3. Validation Agent:
   - Detects name discrepancy
   - Returns conflict details
   - Handoff → Reasoning Agent

4. Reasoning Agent:
   - Asks user: "Mehmet Emin mi, Mehmet Tamer mi?"
   - Waits for clarification
   - Proceeds based on answer
```

### Example 2: Complex Request
```
User: "Geçen ay gönderdiğim fotoğrafları bul ve web'de benzer ürünleri ara"

1. Reasoning Agent:
   - Analyzes: "Multi-step: file search + web research"
   - Handoff → File Agent

2. File Agent:
   - Retrieves photos from last month
   - Sends files to user
   - Handoff → Reasoning Agent

3. Reasoning Agent:
   - Analyzes photos for products
   - Handoff → Web Agent

4. Web Agent:
   - Searches for similar products
   - Returns search results
   - Handoff → Reasoning Agent

5. Reasoning Agent:
   - Synthesizes complete response
```
